99999 makes the program unresponsive
9999 results:
    class ULLMap: 7.99 sec
    class BSTMap: 4.21 sec
    Java's Built-in TreeMap: 4.27 sec
    Java's Built-in HashMap: 4.44 sec


We can observe that the unordered list takes N time, BSTMap takes roughly O(log N), and the TreeMap and HashMap take Theta(log n)

I am running this program on an M2 Macbook Air. I was surprised it freezed on 99999.
