For sum

1. can i pop the items on the list, and store that in an array to perform a sum
    a. that would be destructive
2. Loop through each sentinel.next.item from tail to head recursively adding the items
    b. preserve the list structure and just return a sum




    public int sum() {
            // destructive root seems easier for me right now
            // this implementation fails the last test. The method should be non-destructive because we
            can alter the structure of Stack and recall the sum method for a new sum
            int initialSize = mySSL.size();
            int[] popSumsDestructive = new int[initialSize];
            for (int idx = 0; idx < initialSize; idx++) {
                int addMe = mySSL.getFirst();
                popSumsDestructive[idx] = addMe;
                mySSL.removeTop();
            }
            int total = 0;
            for (int num : popSumsDestructive) {
                total += num;
            }
            return total;
        }


// try 2

        IntNode p = sentinel.next;
        int captured = 0;
        while (p.next != null) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= idx; i++) {
                int captureMe = getFirst();
                captured = captureMe;
                p = p.next;
            }
        }
        return captured;


// try 3, worked on first test

    // SLList java
    public int getItem(int idx) {
        IntNode p = sentinel; // need to start at first real node
        int captured = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < idx; i++) {
            p = p.next;
            int captureMe = p.item;
            captured = captureMe;
        }
        return captured;
    }

    // stack java
        public int sum() {
            // compute the sum of the numbers on stack
            // no restriction on run time for this method
            int lenSSL = mySSL.size();
            int total = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i <= lenSSL; i++) {
            // this can be simplified instead of creating a new variable
                // for arithmetic
                int arithmetic = mySSL.getItem(i);
                total += arithmetic;
            }
            return total;
        }



// ai adjusted my solution because they think that error is the reason why

public int getItem(int idx) {
    IntNode p = sentinel.next; // start at first real node
    // instead of writing it to the same variable outside the loop just return it
    for (int i = 0; i < idx; i++) {
        p = p.next;
    }
    return p.item;
}

public int sum() {
    int lenSSL = mySSL.size();
    int total = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < lenSSL; i++) {   // careful: < not <=
        total += mySSL.getItem(i);
    }
    return total;
}


// **This was the correct reason** debugger is actually treating the list the same. ai recommended removing static from the stack java?


// StackClient flipped

1. Non destructive, and with recursion until we hit base case where sentinel.next == null
    then call push on 100, 10, and then 1
2. Non destructive, iteratively by adding

        It seems like called getItem on the SLList object is not working
        // I am going to just destructively call push based on the popped item

        You can solve it destructively or you can just make the instantion static for SLList and it
            would be non destructive
