isopen and open:
1. two dimensional array booleans, open you flip the square to truth, is open returns whats in the bo; created in the class



open
    1. scan through all of them to
    2. disjoint sets data type problem 
    3. WeightedQuickUnionUF
        1. uses union instead of connect
        2. uses connected isConnected
        3. find for a set 
        4. record the connectedness of the union command 
    4. Assign each square a number
    5. helper function: 
        xyTo1D(int r, int c) method gives xyTo1D(2, 4) = 14
    6. calling open(0, 2) will lead to union(2, 7) and union(7, 12) i.e. when it percolates and connects from top to bottom or just connects

2. Obey the rules, methods take constant time for certain methods

isFull:
    1. disjoint union saves time
    2. name is disjoint sets 
    3. solution is virtual top set and bottom set; issue becomes backwash (i.e. backwash is when it says it connects to top to bottom)
