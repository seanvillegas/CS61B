Lecture 3 Week 2

Task:

	1. Build List in Java
	2. Requires recursion, infinite expansion
	3. int first; and IntList rest; 
	4. Two versions of same method size() iterativeSize() 
	5. Make .get method 
	6. size() can be created with recursion or a while loop and counter

	1. Reflection lets you bypass private; rarely used
	2. The implementation that Prof Hug showed was a naked list, requiring knowledge of recursion to interact with it. 
	3. There is a bug in addLast, if there is no elements present it will not work
	4. Need to add sentinel and invariant
	5. Calculate size by "caching" that data each time its called on
	6. addLast method is slow
	7. cant add integers
	8. there is other implementation that allows you to add multiple types in the list with arrays??

Project heavy notes: 

1. Caching will work for addFirst and get. Remove will not be fast
2. How do you make remove operation faster? 
3. How do you make the addLast operation fast? 
	- doubly linked lists, i.e. keep track of pointers from back to front and front to back
4. Implement doubly linked lists (double sentinel at front and last) to handle the cases of if checks
	- for if a node is real. sometimes it points at sentinel, and sometimes it points at real node
5. The best method is the Doubly Linked list (Circular Sentinel)
	- its a world view
	- the sentinel points to end of list and to the front of the list
	- as you add elements in the middle and call next, you will eventually reach to the front and back of the list through the pointer sentinel
	- prof hug recommends you do this
 6. Defering type selection (filling in a placeholder) acts like a parameter when you use the list so it can accept any type. You can also not pass in the type and somehow it works
7. .java file implementing data structure, specify generic type only once at top of file
8. use <> for instantiation
9. use reference types instead of primitive types
